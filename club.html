    <p class="sectionA small text">
        Whether you're planning on becoming a physicist,<br>
        or you just enjoy doing math, we have lectures<br>
        made to prepare you for whatever you need. We<br>
        will also do lectures to help you get ahead in<br>
        the Sidwell math curriculum too.

    <p class="medium text subtitle2">This Week's Lectures</p>
    <p class="small text sectionB">
        On Thursday, we'll start Single Variable calculus<br>
        since it's needed for the rest of the lectures<br>
        this year. We'll start with limits, and then move<br>
        into differentiation and antiderivatives. This will<br>
        set us up to go into basic Linear Algebra next, and then<br>
        begin modeling more complex systems using equations.<br>
        <br>
        On Monday to prep for the USACO, I'm doing lectures<br>
        on Big O, Big Theta, and Big Omega time complexity<br>
        and if there's time we'll start to cover some<br>
        advanced but useful data structures & optimization<br>
        techniques.
